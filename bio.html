    <h1>A little about me...</h1>
    <p>I was born in New York City, but raised in a New Jersey suburb. Still, I often claim to be a New Yorker -- I mean I can basically see the George Washington Bridge from my house... close enough! I have two brothers, twin and little, and a poodle named Rocky. I went to public high school, where I had no experience with computer science. I did a lot of reading and writing and volunteering in high school. I love to travel and I have competed in Track and Field since middle school - I am also on the Varsity team at Tufts. I am now a Sophomore studying Human Factors/Engineering Psychology and Computer Science from the Arts and Sciences school.</p>
