    <p>A little about me...</p></div>
    <div id = "bio-body">
    <p>I was born in New York City, but raised in a New Jersey suburb. Still, I often claim to be a New Yorker -- I mean I can basically see the George Washington Bridge from my house! I have two brothers: one twin and one senior in high school. I went to public high school, where I had no exposure to computer science. I always loved reading, writing, and math so it was not until attending Tufts that I finally narrowed down on a field of interest. I am now a Sophomore studying Human Factors/Engineering Psychology and Computer Science from the Arts and Sciences school.</p></div>
