<!-- README for HW1 -->

1. IMPLEMENTATION
    This website was creating using html and css documents. The home page contains links to a resume and short bio. All files are part of a special repository on GitHub. All content is created in the html files, while styling/formatting is solely defined in the style sheet. The home page has an image (not real) and my name as well as the links, and the resume has all required sections. Originially I had trouble redirecting my cs account to the home page I created, and I had all project files in the public_html directory, but I realized the index.html file should be the only file in the public directory.

2. COLLABORATION
    I discussed this assignment in English (not code) with Darby Huye. I also went to office hours and discussed redirecting with Alex Caulfield.

3. HOURS SPENT
    I spent about 5-7 hours on this assingment.
