<!-- README for HW1 -->

1. IMPLEMENTATION
    This website was creating using html and css documents. The home page contains links to a resume and short bio. All files are part of a special repository on GitHub. All content is created in the html files, while styling/formatting is solely defined in the style sheet. The home page has an image (not real) and my name as well as the links, and the resume has all required sections.

2. COLLABORATION
    I discussed this assignment in English (not code) with Darby Huye.

3. HOURS SPENT
    I spent about 5-7 hours on this assingment.
